# DuckRace
How fast a duck with an iterative learning MPC can go?

Someone had to figure out.

Work in progress...

Localization in PoliAutolab: https://github.com/giuliovv/poliautolab
Implementation on real track: https://github.com/giuliovv/duckrace-implementation

**N.B.** Ubuntu is required (Windows is not supported by Duckietown)
